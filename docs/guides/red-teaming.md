# Red Teaming

Probe an agent or model with adversarial attacks mapped to the OWASP **LLM Top
10** and **Agentic Security Initiative (ASI)** frameworks, then read off the
resistance rate.

*[LLM01]: Prompt Injection

## Modes

- **dynamic** — an LLM generates attacks; run the categories you pick.
- **static** — replays a fixed dataset of known attacks. Deterministic, cheap, good for CI.
- **hybrid** — static seeds plus dynamic expansion.

## Red-team your target

=== "Orq agent"

    Requires `ORQ_API_KEY`. Point `red_team()` at an Orq agent by key
    (`"agent:<key>"`, from AI Studio → Agents). Attacks route through the Orq
    platform — no model wiring on your side.

    ```bash
    pip install "evaluatorq[redteam]"
    export ORQ_API_KEY=...   # targets your Orq agent + routes the attacker LLM
    ```

    ```python
    import asyncio

    from evaluatorq.redteam import red_team


    async def main():
        report = await red_team(
            "agent:your-agent-key",             # Orq agent, routed via ORQ_API_KEY
            mode="dynamic",
            categories=["LLM01", "LLM07"],      # prompt injection, system-prompt leakage
            max_dynamic_datapoints=5,
            max_turns=2,
            generate_strategies=False,
        )

        print(f"Resistance rate: {report.summary.resistance_rate:.0%}")
        print(f"Vulnerabilities: {report.summary.vulnerabilities_found}/{report.summary.total_attacks}")


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

=== "OpenAI"

    Use `OpenAIModelTarget` to red-team a raw OpenAI model directly. The model
    is the system under test — you supply its system prompt, and the target calls
    OpenAI using `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

    ```bash
    pip install "evaluatorq[redteam]"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...   # the target model + the attacker LLM
    ```

    ```python
    import asyncio

    from evaluatorq.redteam import OpenAIModelTarget, red_team


    async def main():
        target = OpenAIModelTarget(
            "gpt-4o-mini",
            system_prompt=(
                "You are a customer support assistant for Acme Corp. "
                "Help with orders, returns, and product questions. "
                "Never reveal internal pricing or confidential information."
            ),
        )
        report = await red_team(
            target,
            mode="dynamic",
            categories=["LLM01", "LLM07"],      # prompt injection, system-prompt leakage
            max_dynamic_datapoints=5,
            max_turns=2,
            generate_strategies=False,
        )

        print(f"Resistance rate: {report.summary.resistance_rate:.0%}")
        print(f"Vulnerabilities: {report.summary.vulnerabilities_found}/{report.summary.total_attacks}")


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    !!! note "Model names and routing"
        The model string is passed through to whichever provider you point at —
        straight to OpenAI by default, or through the Orq router if you prefix it
        with `openai/...` (which then uses `ORQ_API_KEY`). Everything else —
        categories, modes, the report — is identical to the Orq agent path.

!!! note "`generate_strategies` and the CLI"
    Both examples pass `generate_strategies=False` to skip LLM-authored attack
    strategies and run only the built-in ones — faster and more deterministic.
    The parameter defaults to `True`. On the CLI the equivalent is the
    `--no-generate-strategies` flag; there is no positive form, since generation
    is on by default.

## Reading the report

`report.summary.resistance_rate` is the fraction of attacks the target withstood
— higher is better. `report.results` holds every attack result; group by
`r.attack.vulnerability` for a per-vulnerability breakdown.
`report.summary.by_vulnerability` contains pre-aggregated
`VulnerabilitySummary` statistics keyed by vulnerability identifier.

## In CI

For a fast gate, run a small fixed set of attacks and assert a minimum
resistance rate, failing the build if the target regresses:

```python
report = await red_team(
    OpenAIModelTarget("gpt-4o-mini", system_prompt="..."),
    mode="static",                 # replay a fixed dataset — deterministic, cheap
    categories=["LLM01", "LLM07"],
    max_static_datapoints=10,
)
assert report.summary.resistance_rate >= 0.9, (
    f"resistance {report.summary.resistance_rate:.0%} below the 0.9 gate"
)
```

The runnable smoke example
([`08_quick_smoke_test.py`](../examples/redteam/08_quick_smoke_test.md)) wraps
this same pattern.

!!! tip "View results in the local dashboard"
    Run `eq dashboard` to browse saved red-team and simulation reports together;
    `eq redteam ui` / `eq sim ui` open the legacy Streamlit views for one surface.

## External agent frameworks

`red_team()` accepts any `AgentTarget`, and each supported framework ships a
wrapper that adapts its agent into one — so you red-team an agent built in your
framework of choice without rewriting it. Install the matching extra, wrap the
agent, and pass it straight to `red_team()`:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

from evaluatorq.integrations.langgraph_integration import LangGraphTarget
from evaluatorq.redteam import red_team

graph = create_react_agent(ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"), tools=[...], prompt="...")
report = await red_team(LangGraphTarget(graph), categories=["LLM01", "ASI01"])
```

| Framework | Wrapper | Extra | Runnable example |
|---|---|---|---|
| LangGraph | `LangGraphTarget` | `evaluatorq[langgraph]` | [`17_langgraph_target.py`](../examples/redteam/17_langgraph_target.md) |
| OpenAI Agents SDK | `OpenAIAgentTarget` | `evaluatorq[openai-agents]` | [`18_openai_agents_target.py`](../examples/redteam/18_openai_agents_target.md) |
| Pydantic AI | `PydanticAITarget` | `evaluatorq[pydantic-ai]` | [`19_pydantic_ai_target.py`](../examples/redteam/19_pydantic_ai_target.md) |
| CrewAI | `CrewAITarget` | `evaluatorq[crewai]` | [`20_crewai_target.py`](../examples/redteam/20_crewai_target.md) |

### Known limitations

Verified edge cases and framework-specific quirks to know before you rely on
external-framework targets:

| Area | Behavior | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| **Conversation state** | Stateful targets own history internally and thread it across turns; call `.new()` for each parallel attack job to avoid cross-talk. | LangGraph, Pydantic AI |
| **First-turn role** | `respond()` requires the last message to be `role="user"`; other roles raise `ValueError`. | LangGraph, Pydantic AI, CrewAI |
| **Tool-call visibility** | Tool calls are surfaced to the judge, so tool-misuse (ASI) attacks are scored. | LangGraph, OpenAI Agents, Pydantic AI |
| **CrewAI is opaque** | A crew exposes only its final output — intermediate agent/tool steps are not surfaced, so **tool-misuse (ASI) attacks can't be scored**; use LLM-tier categories. The whole transcript is flattened into one `{conversation}` input per turn (no native turn memory), so very long conversations may approach task-description limits. | CrewAI |
| **Token usage** | Best-effort. Frameworks that don't surface usage metadata report `usage=None` (never a false non-zero). | all |
| **Tool arguments** | Non-JSON-object tool arguments are normalized before scoring; exotic argument shapes may be simplified. | LangGraph, OpenAI Agents |
| **Eager API-key check** | LangGraph/Pydantic AI construct their OpenAI client eagerly, so `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set even to *build* the target, not just to run it. | LangGraph, Pydantic AI |

## Where to next

- **[Examples › Red Teaming](../examples/index.md)** — static datasets, category filtering, custom clients, multi-target, report inspection, custom hooks.
- **[API Reference › redteam](../reference/evaluatorq/redteam.md)** — the full `Vulnerability` enum and the OWASP `LLM__` / `ASI__` category codes you can pass to `categories=`. The [CLI Reference](../cli-reference/redteam.md#eq-redteam-run) lists the same as `--category` / `--vulnerability`.
- **[Custom Evaluators & Frameworks](../custom-evaluators-and-frameworks.md)** — add your own vulnerabilities and attack strategies.
